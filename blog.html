<p>Applied Arts 2015 Design Awards are happening!<br>
</p>
<p>Recently I found out that The 2015 Applied Arts Design Awards is open for submissions. </p>
<p>The awards were launched more than 20 years ago, the competition celebrates the very best work produced throughout North America and abroad. All winning entries become part of the Applied Arts Awards Archive. Winners will also be displayed at the Annual Applied Arts Winners' Exhibit showcased to hundreds of people from the creative industry. The deadline for entries is March 13, 2015.<br>
